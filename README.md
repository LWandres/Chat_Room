# Chat-Room
A straightforward Chat Room where users can communicate in real-time.

Want to try it out, but flying solo? This app stores session data, but if you use an incognito browser to chat with your current browser, that should do the trick!

Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, socket.io, HTML/CSS, jQuery

Involvement: Individual Project - Web Developer
